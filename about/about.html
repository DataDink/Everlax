		What is Everlax?
	</h1>
	<p>
		Everlax is a jQuery plugin that takes the concept of parallaxing multiple images and animates it. 
		With Everlax you can send any number of repeating background images in any one of 360 directions in a seamless, everlasting loop.
	</p>
	<image src="images/about-fig1.png" default="" />
	<p>
		The parallaxing effect is accomplished by setting multiple backgrounds on a single element using images of different sizes.
		Each image will travel in the same direction, but will require a different speed in order to "loop" at the same time as the other images.
	</p>
	<div id="about-fig2" data-interaction="everlax" data-everlax-direction="0" data-everlax-duration="10s"></div>
	<p>
		In order for the animation to be continuous, the repeating background image must start its animation in the same location that it stops.
		To accomplish this at different angles Everlax must determine how many times an image must repeat horizontally and vertically and in some cases "fudge" the requested angle a small bit in order to make the animation seamless.
	</p>
	<div class="about-fig3" data-interaction="everlax" data-everlax-direction="225" data-everlax-duration="10s"></div>
	<div class="about-fig3" data-interaction="everlax" data-everlax-direction="270" data-everlax-duration="10s"></div>
	<div class="about-fig3" data-interaction="everlax" data-everlax-direction="315" data-everlax-duration="10s"></div>
	<p>
		Everlax uses the latest in HTML5/CSS3 specifications for the best performance and the smallest requirements on system resources.
		As a result, however, the Everlax effect can only be viewed in the latest versions of the major browsers: 
		<ul>
			<li>Google Chrome v.21</li>
			<li>Mozilla FireFox v.27</li>
			<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer v.10</li>
		</ul>
		The effect may be available in other browsers but this is untested and results may vary.
