		What is Everlax?
	</h1>
	<p>
		Everlax is a jQuery plugin that takes the concept of parallaxing multiple images and animates it. 
		With Everlax you can send any number of repeating background images in any one of 360 directions in a seamless, everlasting loop.
	</p>
	<p>
		The parallaxing effect is accomplished by setting multiple backgrounds on a single element using images of different sizes.
		Each image will travel <a href="#">test link</a> in the same direction, but will require a different speed in order to "loop" at the same time as the other images.
